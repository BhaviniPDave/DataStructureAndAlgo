/**
 * Problem:
 * There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].
 *
 * The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.
 *
 * For example, the correct password is "345" and you enter in "012345":
 * After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is "0", which is incorrect.
 * After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is "01", which is incorrect.
 * After typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is "012", which is incorrect.
 * After typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is "123", which is incorrect.
 * After typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is "234", which is incorrect.
 * After typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is "345", which is correct and the safe unlocks.
 * Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 1, k = 2
 * Output: "10"
 * Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, k = 2
 * Output: "01100"
 * Explanation: For each possible password:
 * - "00" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.
 * - "01" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.
 * - "10" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.
 * - "11" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.
 * Thus "01100" will unlock the safe. "01100", "10011", and "11001" would also unlock the safe.
 *
 * Solution:
 * In order to guarantee to open the box at last, the input password ought to contain all length-n combinations on digits [0..k-1]
 * - there should be k^n combinations in total.
 *
 * To make the input password as short as possible, we'd better make each possible length-n combination on digits [0..k-1]
 * occurs exactly once as a substring of the password. The existence of such a password is proved by De Bruijn sequence:
 *
 * A de Bruijn sequence of order n on a size-k alphabet A is a cyclic sequence in which every possible length-n string on
 * A occurs exactly once as a substring.
 * It has length k^n, which is also the number of distinct substrings of length n on a size-k alphabet;
 * de Bruijn sequences are therefore optimally short.
 *
 * We reuse last n-1 digits of the input-so-far password as below:
 *
 * e.g., n = 2, k = 2
 * all 2-length combinations on [0, 1]:
 * 00 (`00`110),
 *  01 (0`01`10),
 *   11 (00`11`0),
 *    10 (001`10`)
 *
 * the password is 00110
 * We can utilize DFS to find the password:
 *
 * goal: to find the shortest input password such that each possible n-length combination of digits [0..k-1]
 * occurs exactly once as a substring.
 *
 * node: current input password
 *
 * edge: if the last n - 1 digits of node1 can be transformed to node2 by appending a digit from 0..k-1,
 * there will be an edge between node1 and node2
 *
 * start node: n repeated 0's
 * end node: all n-length combinations among digits 0..k-1 are visited
 *
 * visitedComb: all combinations that have been visited
